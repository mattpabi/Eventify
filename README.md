## IMPORTANT

The `qrcode` folder contains code from a third-party library, with its development led by Lincoln Loop.
The code to *generate* and *encode* QR codes for reservations are from the library, but the integration, display, and data inputted into the QR code are developed by me.

**All code, except for the encoding and layout of the QR code, is by me.**



## Custom environment setup
The `.env` was intentionally not added to `.gitignore` to serve as sample environment variables.

To set your own administrator login credentials, edit the variables in the `.env` file BEFORE running `main.py` for the first time.
